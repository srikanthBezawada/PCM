/**
 * Calculates the cohesiveness measure of a nodeset.
 * 
 * The cohesiveness of a {@link uk.ac.rhul.cs.cl1.NodeSet} is defined as the total internal weight
 * of the nodeset divided by the sum of the total internal and boundary weight
 * of the nodeset.
 * 
 * Optionally, the user may also specify a penalty value for each node. If the
 * penalty is nonzero, it is assumed that each node in the nodeset (and also the
 * ones to be added) has an extra boundary weight equal to the value of the
 * penalty. This can be used to account for situations when the dataset is noisy;
 * in this case, the fact that an external boundary node of a nodeset has a single
 * boundary edge towards the nodeset and no other (completely external) edges does
 * not necessarily mean that the node should belong to the nodeset; it may happen
 * that the node has more external connections, which are not present in the dataset
 * due to noise. Therefore, the addition of such nodes is feasible only if the
 * connections to the nodeset are strong enough to counterbalance the effect of the
 * penalty.

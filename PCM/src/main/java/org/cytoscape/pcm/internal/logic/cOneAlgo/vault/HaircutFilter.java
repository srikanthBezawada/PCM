/**
 * Accepts all nodesets but performs a haircut operation on them.
 * 
 * The haircut operation removes some nodes from a nodeset based on the total
 * weight of their connections to the rest of the nodeset. First, the total
 * weight of the nodeset and the average weight per node is calculated.
 * After that, we remove nodes where the total weight of adjacent edges with
 * the other endpoint in the nodeset is less than the average weight times
 * a multiplier factor (e.g., 0.2).
 * 
 * There are two variants to the haircut operation. The non-iterative variant
 * finds all the nodes whose internal weight is less than the threshold (the
 * average weight times the multiplier factor), removes them, and then returns.
 * The iterative variant finds the node whose internal weight is the smallest,
 * checks if it is below the threshold, and if so, removes it. If there was a
 * removal, the iterative variant re-calculates the threshold based on the
 * new average weight and then continues until no removal is possible.
